A personal project aimed at analyzing data, generating statistics, and creating visualizations based on a friendly competition inspired by the question: **"Who has the best intuition for football?"**  
The objective is to develop analytical tools to compare participants' predictions and assess their performance using various metrics, such as points by category, efficiency ratings, and expected points.

This project showcases my practical ability to extract meaningful and comprehensive insights by applying the full data analysis process ‚Äî from data extraction, cleaning, and transformation to the design of impactful and intuitive visualizations tailored to a target audience.

It is based on a real-life use case with engaging and playful data, which allows me to refine my technical skills through the integration of multiple data analysis tools. For its development, I used **Google Sheets, Excel, and BigQuery** to store, extract, clean, and transform the data, and **Tableau** and **R** (in both **Visual Studio Code** and **RStudio**) to analyze the data and produce dashboards and visualizations.
